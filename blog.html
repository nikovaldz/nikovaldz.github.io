			<h2><a href="#">Why I Love Horror</a></h2>
			<p><em>Published June 16, 2025</em></p>
		</header>
		<p>I’m not exactly sure when I first fell in love with horror. I’ve always been drawn to dark things. Maybe it started when I discovered Edgar Allan Poe in grade school — his rhythm, his morbidity, the way he made dread feel beautiful.</p>
		<p>For a while, I actually thought I didn’t like horror movies. The ones I saw were cliché and boring. But then I found the genre’s other face: the psychological, the gothic, the raw social and personal commentary hidden just beneath the surface. And of course, I also just love a good splatter comedy.</p>
		<p>Right now, my top three favorite horror films are <em>Army of Darkness</em>, <em>The Thing</em>, and <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em>. Each one tells a story, evokes a feeling, and fully commits to its world. That’s what I love about horror: how it lets you explore subtle emotions through extreme, often grotesque imagery. It’s the genre of transformation, of metaphor made flesh.</p>
		<p>A lot of my writing has roots in horror. <em>Shrouded</em>, my feature-length screenplay, is a psychological horror and family drama about an estranged daughter reconnecting with her schizophrenic father — a man haunted by dark figures that begin to bleed into reality. My short film <em>Deadline</em> taps into paranoia and uncertainty through the presence of an ominous neighbor. And <em>Autopsy Report</em>, my poetry collection, dissects the body and the psyche with the clinical eye of someone who once studied nursing and anatomy. A form of body horror turned inward.</p>
		<p>Horror, to me, isn’t just about fear. It’s about exposure. It’s about showing what we normally try to keep buried. Finding something human inside of it. An obscured truth.</p>
